This is a port of the 'Canvas Cycle' animated pixel art images, originally created by [Mark Ferrari](https://www.markferrari.com/), to a Wallpaper Engine web wallpaper.

Specifically it is based on the HTML5 color cycling implementation by Joseph Huckaby, which can be found here: http://www.effectgames.com/demos/canvascycle/

### Development

All the Wallpaper Engine relevant code is in the `main.js` file. The properties are handled at the top, the rest is hacked into various places in the original code. 

The `build.bat` and `build_exclude.txt` are used to just copy only the required files to another folder, so that the actual Steam Workshop size is smaller.
